# Jose Sanchez Gonzalez

I build robot perception, simulation, and the software to evaluate them.
Seeking robotics software and perception / ML engineering roles.

*One controlled Isaac Sim episode. Classical RGB-D tracking, simulator depth and rigid-piece release; this is not a learned pruning policy or a wood-fracture model.*

## Featured work

| Project | What I built | Evidence and limits |
|---|---|---|
| [Vision-guided pruning](https://github.com/joses2017smjh/isaac-sim-pruning-workflow) | RGB-D control, dual-ToF release checks, and an independent recording grader. | Published success and stopped-closure recordings; one selected episode passes 17/17 sequence checks. |
| [SPUR metric depth](https://github.com/joses2017smjh/spur-depth-service) | Depth inference API, multi-view refinement and split ONNX export. | Synthetic validation: 0.0445 ± 0.0057 m RMSE for the published three-pair refiner. Real-orchard accuracy remains unverified. |
| [Humanoid Robustness Ladder](https://github.com/joses2017smjh/bhl-robustness-ladder) | Isaac Lab curricula, MuJoCo evaluation and controls that expose task failures. | Cross-simulator measurements, scored recordings and a public findings ledger. Hardware walking is not claimed. |
| [MetaNaviT](https://github.com/joses2017smjh/MetaNavT) | Hybrid retrieval, source tracing and reviewable file operations. | Recall@50 0.938 on 136 queries / 61 fixture files, using hash embeddings and overlap reranking. |

## Technical focus

Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab, MuJoCo, ONNX Runtime,
FastAPI and Slurm. I connect model outputs to measurable behavior, document
failure cases, and keep demos linked to the code and evaluation that support them.

The [portfolio](https://jose-sanchez-portfolio-com.vercel.app/#projects) provides
short visual case studies; the repositories contain setup, architecture,
results and current limitations.
